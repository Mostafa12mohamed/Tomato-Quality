# Tomato-Quality
Tomato Quality Project Using Deep Learning
 advanced Deep Learning techniques to assess tomato freshness automatically! 🌱💡

🔍 Project Overview: I’ve been working with a dataset of 6,470 tomato images, graded from class 1 (freshest) to class 10 (most rotten). I focused on a 6-class classification task by merging nearby classes, aiming to optimize accuracy in predicting freshness.

📜 This dataset is part of the research presented in the paper “FGrade: A Large Volume Dataset for Grading Tomato Freshness Quality” by Sikha Das, Samarjit Kar, and Arif Ahmed Sekh, published at the 5th International Conference, CVIP 2020, in Prayagraj, India. The paper discusses quality-based grading of tomatoes and benchmarks using state-of-the-art classification methods.

🔧 Models & Techniques: I explored several advanced models using transfer learning:

- CNN

- ResNet50

- EfficientNet

- InceptionNet

- VGG16

- MobileNet
